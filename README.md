# My First Spring Boot Project

Just a simple project from a Spring Boot course I'm taking currently.

Works on LocalHost port 911 and is built with the Spring Boot Framework using Maven.

#### Added dependencies in pom.xml:

    1. Spring boot devtools.
    2. Spring boot starter actuator.
    3. Spring boot security.
    4. Spring boot maven plugin.
    5. Spring boot starter web.

These dependencies can be gotten from [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) website.

#### What does this project do?

It's just a beginner project that contains changing point, implementing endpoints, and using annotations such as GetMapping, RestController, and Value.
